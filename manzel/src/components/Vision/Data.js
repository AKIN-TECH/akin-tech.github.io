Traditional teaching methods are: Good and beneficial to a certain point,lacking in the visualization of information, students (us included) were shocked by the vast difference between written words and the Real-world, so Manzel is our solution to this problem that will change education forever. Our mission impossible is to change all aspects of education, at all levels, from kids to experts, from zero to hero, at all aspects of life, handing knowledge on a silver glass (not dish because that would be weird!!). Provide better education to everyone, because great education is the core of a great society.",
